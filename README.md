Done the navigation and mega-menu + login part so far. Im still focusing on getting more practice with scss. 
To show the elements of the mega-menu of the mobile media queries, i wanted to use jquery at first(to remove and add classes) but it was getting too messy 
so i decided to just style it using scss with check inputs and radio inputs and displaying them as 'none', 'block' or changing their visibility whenever i had
to show/hide elements from the menu.
I still have to make some changes regarding the media queries for tablets.
